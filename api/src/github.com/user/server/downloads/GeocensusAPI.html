<h3>Geocensus API</h3>
<hr>
<p>This Geocensus project is designed so that anyone can get population density<br>
information about a wide vareity of geocensus variable data(Total population,<br>
population by age, sex, race, etc.) based on data from the years 2005-2010.</p>

<h3>Map Interface</h3>
<hr>
<p>http://.../map.html<br>
The client side of the Geocensus Api. It displays a map made with Leaflet<br>
that a user can interact with and display population density data on three<br>
different sumlevels: States, Counties, and Census Tracts. Working with States<br>
displays all information for all states at once when selected.Working with<br>
County and Tract data is very large and as such you can only display information<br>
for one county or state at a time.<br><br>

Under the interactive map, there are six drop down menus. The first menu<br>
displays the list of variables that you can query census data for.<br>
The second drop down menu displays the sum levels you can select.<br>
The third drop down menu is used for selecting the state or county<br>
you wish to obtain information for. If the sum level selected is states,<br>
then the selected state only matters when performing large queries. The<br>
fourth dropdown menu is where the subsets of the first dropdown menu are<br>
stored. The fifth dropdown menu displays the current list of variables added<br>
by the "Add Var" button. The final dropdown menu is used to check whether<br>
the user wishes to create a shapefile or not.<br><br>
Under the six dropdown menu options are four buttons. The first button,<br>
"Add Var", adds the currently selected values in the second, third, and<br>
fourth dropdown menus to an array in memory. Based on the first<br>
state/county and sumlevel selected, any further variables added to the<br>
array will always be for that state and sumlevel until "Clear Var List" is<br>
pressed or the page is refreshed. This second "Clear Var List" button also<br>
clears out the fifth dropdown menu so as to allow new queries to be ran on<br>
a new set of variables. The third button, "Perform Large Query", does one<br>
two things depending on the value in the sixth dropdown menu. If shapefile<br>
is selected in the sixth dropdown menu, pressing this button will create a<br>
zip file containing information added to the fifth dropdown menu. If<br>
Geojson is selected, then the information from the fifth dropdown menu<br>
will be displayed in the console. The last button, recolor, recolors the<br>
map on the map page based on the currently selected items in the second,<br>
third, and fourth dropdown menu.</p>

<h3>Obtaining Census Variables</h3>
<hr>
<p>http://.../ACS2010_5YEAR
This route is used to obtain the list of census variables a user may select.
It takes no input. It's output is of the following form as a object array
of key value pairs:
</p>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
<pre>
	[
		{

			//Table_ID:Geocensus category(Stub)
			ID:"Stub",
			B00001:"Unweighted Sample Count Of Population",
			B00002:"Unweighted Sample Housing Units",
			...

		}
	]


</pre>
</div>
<p><br><br>The above is complished in the client code with the following<br>
call to AJAX:<br>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
	<pre>
$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost:3000/ACS2010_5YEAR/",
    type: "GET",
    data: { table_ID: "x"},
    dataType: 'json' 
  })
 	</pre>
</div>
<h3>Creating Subset Listing Of Census Variables</h3>
<hr>
<p>http://.../ACS2010_5YEAR<br>
After the above Get request is performed, depending on what option the<br>
client selects, a subset of the possible selections of geovariables is<br>
created in the fourth drop down menu. This row takes as input the<br>
Table_ID from the previous Get request. It's output is the list of<br>
subset tuples in the final select column. The output data is formatted<br>
as follows in an array of key value pairs:<br>
</p>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
<pre>
	[
		{

			//Table_ID:Geocensus subcategory
			"B01001001 Total:",
			"B01001002 Male:",
			"B01001003 Under 5 years",
			"B01001004 5 to 9 years",
			...
		}
	]


</pre>
</div>
<p>The above uses an ajax request similar to the previous one.</p><br>

<h3>Topojson Format Of State Tracts</h3>
<hr>
<p>"http://.../states/:geoid/tracts"<br>
While other parts of the Leaflet code use prebuilt objects to display<br>
boundaries for States and Counties, the method used to obtain prebuilt<br>
tracts is quite different because tracts are obtained one state at a time<br>
for efficiency reasons. As such, this path takes in the state for which<br>
the tracts are being obtained for and outputs an object suitable to be<br>
converted into topojson format. The output is as follows:<br></p>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
<pre>
	"{
	  "type": "FeatureCollection",
	  "features": 
	[{"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-86.556074,34.674245],[-86.555981,34.67491],[-86.555812,34.676024],[-86.555736,34.676407],
	[-86.555169,34.677997],[-86.555089,34.67821],[-86.554674,34.679362],[-86.554246,34.680574],[-86.554195,34.680893],
	[-86.554202,34.681468],[-86.5542,34.681857],[-86.554184,34.68192],[-86.554156,34.682035],...
</pre>
</div>
<pre>The above is obtained with the slightly different ajax post request:
	$.ajax({
        url: "http://localhost:3000/states/36/tracts",
        type: "POST",
      data: { geoCen: "", state:""+state+""},
      async: false
    })
</pre>
<h3>Obtaining State Names</h3>
<hr>
<p>"http://.../ACS2010_5YEAR/states"<br>
This path is used to get the full names of states and counties associated<br>
in the database to display in the third column of the map page. This<br>
list is only filled when the user tries to select county or tract data<br>
to look up since that data for organization and clarity purposes. This<br>
tract will take no input and returns the list of states and their<br>
associated geoid's as an array of key value pairs:<br>
</p>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
<pre>
	"{
		[
			//State name:geoid
			Alaska:"02",
			Alabama:"01",
			Arakansas:"05",
			...
		]

	}"
</pre>
</div>
<pre>This is done using the following ajax POST request:
	$.ajax({
      url: "http://localhost:3000/ACS2010_5YEAR/states",
      type: "POST",
      data: { stateList:"", countyList:"", geoVar:""},
      dataType: 'json' 
    })
</pre>

<h3> Obtaining Population Densities</h3>
<hr>
<p>http://.../ACS2012_5YEAR/Query<br>
This pathname is where the actual population densities are<br>
obtained, formated, and returned to be displayed. It takes<br>
as input a state's geoid for tract look ups, the sum level,<br>
and the census variable selected from the third select object<br>
on map html and returns an array of key value pairs for each<br>
state, tract, or county selected. The output is of the following<br>
form:<br></p>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#EEEEEE">
<pre>
	{
		[
		//Array of census variables
		//"Geoid":# of geoid
		{[

			//Census variable:population
			B000010001:64785

		]}
		"Geoid":02,
		...
		]
	}
</pre>
</div>
<pre>The ajax call used is as follows:
	$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost:3000/ACS2012_5YEAR/Query",
    type: "POST",
    data: { stateList:""+state+"", countyList:""+$('#lookupType').val()+"", geoVar:"('"+cenVar+"')"},
    dataType: 'json' ,
    async: false
  })
</pre>
<h3>Performing a large query</h3>
<hr>
<p>http://.../ACS2012_5YEAR/QuerySpecial/:filetype<br>
This pathname is used to perform the large query on a given<br>
data set and returns a string as a result. This string will<br>
will return in jsonformat and will either be a success message<br>
or display an object array containing the desired values.<br>
The given filetype is used to determine whether to create a<br>
zip file or not. This path takes as input the array of<br>
geovariables, the sum level, and the selected state, county,<br>
or tract. The ajax call made to the path is as follows:<br><br>

<pre>$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost:3030/ACS2012_5YEAR/QuerySpecial/"+reType+"",
    type: "POST",
    data: { stateList:selectedStCtTr[0], countyList:selectedSumLevel[0], geoVar:variableArray},
    dataType: 'json' 
  })
</pre>
